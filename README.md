## Information

The goal of this project was to design, implement, and test algorithms that enable an autonomous vehicle to navigate through a dynamic and complex environment. The Carla simulator was chosen as the testing ground to simulate real-world driving scenarios, allowing for the development and evaluation of robust autonomous driving systems.

For more details about the project, including a comprehensive analysis and results, refer to the final report available in the [Project Report](docs/Project_Report.pdf) file.
